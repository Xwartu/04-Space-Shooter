Rocket and missile asset made by me. A lot of other assets will be from Kenny (Shown in video)

This project is ridiculously late, that's on me and I'm going to own up to that. Luckily I don't think it will destroy my grade, but again this is not the preferred outcome for me or you I would assume. I don't have an excuse, I don't have a reason besides my regular health detractions (lack of energy and permanent spinal injury) but currently none of this is really known or excused by the campus. This is not fair to you the instructor when I turn in a project right before the next one is due. Luckily I have been taking measures to stay caught up with that one as well. I hope the flourish I have added on top is at least a little bit worth the wait (even though I know you're behind on grading, I don't want this to become a habit for myself either.)

Thank you, if you read this little blurb. Enjoy.
